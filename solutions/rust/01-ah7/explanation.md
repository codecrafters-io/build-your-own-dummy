The entry point for your dummy implementation is in `src/main.rs`.

Study and uncomment the relevant code: 

```rust
// Uncomment this to pass the first stage
println!("1");
```

Push your changes to pass the first stage:

```
git add .
git commit -m "pass 1st stage" # any msg
git push origin master
```
